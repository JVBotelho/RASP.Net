## 🎮 Why This Matters for Gaming Security

**The Problem**: Multiplayer game services process **millions of transactions per second**. Traditional WAFs introduce network latency and cannot see inside the encrypted gRPC payload or understanding game logic context.

**The Solution**: RASP.Net acts as a **last line of defense** inside the game server process. It instruments the runtime to detect attacks that bypass perimeter defenses, detecting logic flaws like item duplication exploits or economy manipulation.

**Key Engineering Goals:**
1.  **Zero GC Pressure**: Security checks must NOT trigger Garbage Collection pauses that cause frame drops/lag.
2.  **Sub-Microsecond Latency**: Checks happen in nanoseconds, not milliseconds.
3.  **Defense in Depth**: Complements kernel-level Anti-Cheat (BattlEye/EAC) by protecting the backend API layer.

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

**Methodology:** Benchmarks isolate the intrinsic cost of the detection engine using `BenchmarkDotNet`.
**Hardware:** AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D (4.2GHz) | **Runtime:** .NET 10.0.2

| Payload Size | Scenario | Mean Latency | Overhead vs Baseline | **GC Allocation** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **100 Bytes** | Safe Scan | **12.1 ns** | +11.5 ns | **0 Bytes** |
| | Attack Blocked | **18.4 ns** | +17.8 ns | **0 Bytes** |
| **1 KB** | Safe Scan | **22.2 ns** | +21.6 ns | **0 Bytes** |
| | Attack Blocked | **31.1 ns** | +30.5 ns | **0 Bytes** |
| **10 KB** | Safe Scan | **137.4 ns** | +136.8 ns | **0 Bytes** |
| | Attack Blocked | **156.7 ns** | +156.1 ns | **0 Bytes** |

> **Analysis:** The engine demonstrates **sub-linear scaling** thanks to .NET 10's vectorized optimizations (AVX/SIMD). Inspecting 10KB of data takes only ~0.15μs. Most importantly, **Zero Allocation** is maintained across all scenarios, ensuring **no impact on game server frame budgets**.

## 🛡️ Security Analysis & Threat Modeling

For a comprehensive analysis of attack vectors, STRIDE mapping, and Red Team validation, see:

📄 **[THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/ATTACK_SCENARIOS.md)** - Complete threat analysis including:
- Economy manipulation exploits (SQL injection via gRPC)
- Runtime tampering detection (anti-cheat)
- DoS mitigation strategies (GC pressure attacks)
- Exploitation walkthroughs with Python PoCs

**Key Highlights**:
- ✅ STRIDE analysis matrix with implementation status
- ✅ Real-world attack scenarios from gaming industry
- ✅ Red Team validation with bypass attempts

## 🏗️ Architecture: Composite Solution

This repository utilizes a **Composite Architecture Strategy**.  
It is designed to develop and validate the Security SDK (`Rasp.*`) by instrumenting a real-world "Victim" application (`dotnet-grpc-library-api`) without polluting its source code.

### 📂 Structure

| Directory | Component | Description |
|:----------|:----------|:------------|
| **`src/`** | 🛡️ **The Defense (SDK)** | The RASP Source Code. |
| `├── Rasp.Core` | 🧠 *Kernel* | Detection engine & telemetry contracts |
| `├── Rasp.Instrumentation.Grpc` | 📡 *Sensor* | gRPC request interceptors |
| `├── Rasp.Bootstrapper` | ⚙️ *Loader* | DI extensions (`AddRasp()`) |
| **`modules/`** | 🎯 **The Victim (Target)** | Git submodules |
| `└── dotnet-grpc-library-api` | 🏛️ *App* | Clean Architecture sample |

## 🛡️ How It Works (Attack Flow)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker
    participant gRPC as gRPC Gateway
    participant RASP as 🛡️ RASP.Net
    participant GameAPI as Game Service
    participant DB as Database
    
    Note over Attacker,RASP: 🔴 Attack Scenario: Item Duplication
    Attacker->>gRPC: POST /inventory/add {item: "Sword' OR 1=1"}
    gRPC->>RASP: Intercept Request
    
    activate RASP
    RASP->>RASP: ⚡ Zero-Alloc Inspection
    RASP-->>Attacker: ❌ 403 Forbidden (Threat Detected)
    deactivate RASP
    
    Note over Attacker,DB: 🟢 Legitimate Scenario
    Attacker->>gRPC: POST /inventory/add {item: "Legendary Sword"}
    gRPC->>RASP: Intercept Request
    
    activate RASP
    RASP->>GameAPI: ✅ Clean - Forward Request
    deactivate RASP
    
    GameAPI->>DB: INSERT INTO inventory...
    DB-->>GameAPI: Success
    GameAPI-->>Attacker: 200 OK

## 🚀 Setup & Build

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** This repository relies on submodules. A standard clone will result in missing projects.

### 1. Clone Correctly

Use the `--recursive` flag to fetch the Target Application code:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JVBotelho/RASP.Net.git
```

If you have already cloned without the flag:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Build the Composite Solution

We use a "God Mode" solution file (`Rasp_Dev.sln`) that links both the SDK and the Victim App for a unified debugging experience.
```bash
dotnet build Rasp_Dev.sln
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: `Submodule 'modules/dotnet-grpc-library-api' not found`  
**Solution**: Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

**Problem**: `The type or namespace name 'Rasp' could not be found`  
**Solution**: Ensure you're opening `Rasp_Dev.sln`, not individual `.csproj` files

**Problem**: gRPC service not starting  
**Solution**: Check if port 5001 is already in use: `netstat -ano | findstr :5001`

---

## 🧪 Development Workflow

The Composite Solution allows you to debug the SDK as if it were part of the application, while keeping git histories separate.

1. Open `Rasp_Dev.sln` in Rider or Visual Studio.
2. **Set Startup Project**: Select `LibrarySystem.Api` (from the `modules` folder).
3. **Debug**: Breakpoints in `Rasp.Instrumentation.Grpc` will be hit when requests are sent to the API.

---

## 🛑 Rules of Engagement

- **Modify `src/`**: Commits go to this repository (`RASP.Net`).
- **Modify `modules/`**: Commits go to the `dotnet-grpc-library-api` repository. Do not modify the victim code unless necessary for integration hooks.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Performance Goals

- **Zero-Allocation Hot Paths**: Usage of `Span<T>` and frozen collections to minimize GC pressure during inspection.
- **Observability First**: Native OpenTelemetry integration (`System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource`).
- **Safe by Design**: Strict mode enabled (`<TreatWarningsAsErrors>true`).

---

## 🎯 Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1**: Setup & Vulnerability injection in Target App
- [x] **Phase 2**: gRPC Interceptor with payload inspection
- [ ] **Phase 3**: EF Core Interceptor with SQL analysis 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Benchmarks & Documentation
